# Natural Autonomous Engineering — NUNLauncher

Status: engineering contract and staged adoption plan. This document defines requirements; it does not claim that unimplemented capabilities already exist.

## Intent
Translate the 20 requested directions into practical, testable engineering properties. Prefer native, understandable components; keep the system simple, observable, reversible, and safe.

## The 20 directions as engineering requirements
1. Automatic natural code — automate repetitive, deterministic maintenance only.
2. Independent built-in usability — usable defaults and self-explanatory errors.
3. Automated native consistency — follow repository language, formatter, and conventions.
4. Autonomous natural programming — isolate components and minimize unnecessary dependencies.
5. Self-acting organic network functions — explicit network boundaries, timeouts, retry budgets, and cancellation.
6. Operator-free initial confidence — fail closed on uncertain or invalid inputs.
7. Unattended first-run simplicity — reproducible setup, safe defaults, and clear prerequisites.
8. Programmable source confidence — contracts, type checks, tests, and reproducible validation.
9. Mechanized authentic modularity — preserve a coherent core; split only at real boundaries.
10. Robotic original systemization — deterministic, auditable maintenance workflows.
11. Algorithmic native graphics — real data, units, labels, provenance, and bounded resource use.
12. Cyclic local graphical environment — local-first refresh with explicit lifecycle and cancellation.
13. Continuous internal content — synchronize docs, examples, schemas, and configuration with shipped behavior.
14. Self-regulating file typing — validate formats, size limits, paths, and content before processing.
15. Self-managed cryocapsule modulation — isolated experimental modules with feature flags, resource limits, and rollback.
16. Self-tuning organic averaging — documented normalization/adaptation with explicit bounds and deterministic tests.
17. Auto-start standard layering — staged initialization, dependency ordering, readiness checks, and clean shutdown.
18. Adaptive graphic design — accessible, consistent UI tokens and responsive layouts.
19. Intelligent shell animation — respect reduced-motion settings, frame/resource budgets, and lifecycle cleanup.
20. Self-executing shell creation — generate UI shells only from validated schemas/templates; never execute untrusted generated code.

## Repository-specific application
Boot and application launcher: validate manifests and artifacts before handoff, keep preflight read-only, expose clear recovery paths, use layered startup/readiness checks, and ensure UI animation never blocks safety-critical validation.

## Required implementation sequence
- Inventory existing code, public APIs, workflows, and open PRs before changing behavior.
- Map applicable directions to existing modules or narrowly scoped new modules; mark irrelevant items N/A with a reason.
- Implement in small, reviewable changes; preserve public behavior unless a versioned migration is approved.
- Add normal, boundary, invalid-input, cancellation, and failure-path tests where applicable.
- Update docs/examples with behavior changes; distinguish host tests from platform/hardware qualification.
- Keep experimental behavior behind feature flags, disabled by default until validated.
- Never delete data, rewrite history, force-push, weaken branch protection, or bypass required checks.

## Definition of Done
Relevant formatter, lint, type checker, tests, and build pass. The PR records exact commands and results, states untested targets, includes no secrets or unrelated files, and links each behavior to code and tests.

## Adoption status
This contract is the planning and review baseline. Individual capabilities remain **planned** until implemented and verified in this repository. Documentation alone is not runtime implementation.
